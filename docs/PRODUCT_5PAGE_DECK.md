# SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM

## Marketing Teams Are Drowning in Localization Costs

### The Brutal Reality

**Traditional Campaign Production:**
- 🕐 **3-5 days** per campaign
- 💰 **$2,700** for 36 localized assets
- 🌍 **Manual adaptation** for each market
- ⚠️ **High error rate** in compliance
- 📉 **70-90% budget waste** on repetitive work

### Scale Kills Profitability

```
1 market  = $2,700  |  5 markets  = $13,500  |  40 markets = $108,000
   ↓                      ↓                          ↓
Every campaign          Every quarter           Enterprise brands
```

**The bottleneck:** Creative teams can't scale. AI hasn't solved localization. Until now.
